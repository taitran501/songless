## Expected Console Logs Flow

### 1. Initial Load (TracksProvider)
```
üì¶ [TracksProvider] Loaded tracks from localStorage: X
```

### 2. GamePage Mount
```
üîç [GamePage] Effect 1 - Checking auth and tracks: {

```

### 6. Premium Check

```

## Debugging Steps

### If you see "No access token, redirecting to /":
- Check if `authLoading` is `true` - if so, this is expected, wait for it to become `false`
- Check localStorage for `spotify_access_token`

### If you see "No tracks ‚Äî redirecting back to /playlist":
- Check if `tracksLoading` is `true` - if so, this is expected, wait for it to become `false`
- Check localStorage for `game_tracks`

### If you see "Skipping SDK initialization":
- Check if `premiumCheckDone` is `true`
- Check if `isPremium` is `true`
- Check if `player` already exists

### If you see "Error playing track":
- Check if `deviceId` is set correctly
- Check if `accessToken` is valid
- Check if track URI is valid
- Check Spotify Web API response status

## Common Issues

1. **Token expires**: Check `spotify_expires_at` in localStorage
2. **No tracks in localStorage**: Need to load playlist first
3. **Premium check fails**: User might not have Premium subscription
4. **SDK script fails to load**: Network issue or CDN problem

## Test Commands

```bash
# Check localStorage in browser console
localStorage.getItem("spotify_access_token")
localStorage.getItem("game_tracks")

# Clear everything for fresh test
localStorage.clear()
```
